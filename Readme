	This idea comes from a project which Tsoding made some time ago, the idea
	is to implement a simple spreadsheet engine which is able to do
	basic arithmetic being able to make references to other cells avoiding
	all possible errors, for sure... Also must be able to clone cells from above...

	My implementation does all that, you can see how the syntax is in
	'Sheets/tester' and how some errors are caught by the lexer and parser :)
	such as bad referencing or non-sense tokens.

	./UrSh	-s <filename> -d <decimal-precision>

	Tsoding implementation: https://github.com/tsoding/minicel
